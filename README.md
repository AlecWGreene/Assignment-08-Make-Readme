  ## Description 

This application generates a readme based on user input entered through the Windows Powershell.

  ## Installation 

Download the code from the repo, and run `npm i inquirer` after navigating to the project directory. 


  
  ## Usage 

Once the powershell is open, enter `node index.js` into the console and enter in text under the relevant section headers as they appear. If a section does not look satisfactory or was accidentally submitted, a confirmation prompt will always be given allowing the previous section to be rewritten. Please note that this CLI does not catch enter or shift+enter key presses, so doing so may require the section to be retyped. \n

Keep in mind, the harsh console refreshes are a symptom of the screen capture software's frame capture rate.
